        <p>
          Born and raised in NYC, I received a BFA from NYU Tisch School of the Arts in Film &
          Television, with a focus in Editing and a minor in Performance Studies. My professional
           work has encompassed a wide range of projects,
          from feature-length documentaries to advertising campaigns and branded social content.
          Working across both scripted and unscripted material has sharpened my skills in story 
          developement and deepened my passion
          for crafting human centered narratives.
